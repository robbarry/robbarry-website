      <description>An investigation of insider trading by corporate executives found many make profitable trades prior to news announcements.

      <guid>https://www.robbarry.org/work/2012-04-02-more-killings-called-self-defense/</guid>
      <description>At a time when the overall U.S. homicide rate is declining, more civilians are killing each other and claiming self-defense&amp;ndash;a trend that is most pronounced in states with new &amp;ldquo;stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws.
The U.S. has seen a notable increase in justifiable homicides, particularly in states with &amp;ldquo;stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws, even as the overall homicide rate declines. &amp;ldquo;Stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws allow individuals greater latitude in using force for self-defense outside the home.</description>

      <description>Results from Russia&amp;rsquo;s parliamentary vote earlier this month are studded with red flags that suggest broad electoral fraud, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.
Our analysis of nearly 100,000 voting precincts reveals potential vote-rigging, with up to 14 million votes in question. Higher turnout areas showed suspiciously strong support for Putin&amp;rsquo;s United Russia party. Large-scale protests have erupted in response to allegations of fraud, challenging Putin&amp;rsquo;s political legitimacy. In response, Putin promises transparent measures for upcoming elections.</description>
