We found that corporate insiders often shift from buying to selling their company’s stock as bankruptcy approaches. Our analysis suggests insiders might be privy to their company’s deteriorating conditions ahead of other investors. In the last three months before bankruptcy filings, insider stock buys dropped over 80%, while sales only slightly decreased....</p>

The disclosed prices often don’t reflect the actual amounts paid, with numerous entities like Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers negotiating different rates.

    <p>The U.S. government allocated more than $10 billion under section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote job creation and renewable energy through the establishment of wind farms, solar projects, and other alternative energy initiatives.

This discrepancy underscores the challenges in accurately quantifying the economic impact of stimulus spending, with some plants laying off workers and others shutting down altogether....</p>
