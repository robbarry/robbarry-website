    <p>U.S. companies are beginning to change the way they police trades by executives and other insiders in their company stock.
U.S. companies are revising trading rules for executives, with some introducing longer “cooling-off periods” before trades can occur after establishing preset trading plans. The changes come after a series of Wall Street Journal articles highlighting profitable, well-timed trades by company insiders. Read the full story here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A Wall Street Journal review of thousands of trades by insiders in their own company’s stock found the trades veering heavily toward selling rather than buying as bankruptcy filings drew nearer.
We found that corporate insiders often shift from buying to selling their company’s stock as bankruptcy approaches. Our analysis suggests insiders might be privy to their company’s deteriorating conditions ahead of other investors. In the last three months before bankruptcy filings, insider stock buys dropped over 80%, while sales only slightly decreased....</p>

    <p>The release of government data showing wide variation in hospital pricing removes a layer of secrecy but probably won’t make medical charges more uniform, experts said Wednesday.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released data revealing significant variations in hospital pricing for common treatments from 3,337 hospitals. The disclosed prices often don’t reflect the actual amounts paid, with numerous entities like Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers negotiating different rates. Despite the data’s transparency, experts believe it might not standardize medical charges, and its usefulness for consumers determining out-of-pocket costs is limited....</p>

The use of government-sanctioned 10b5-1 trading plans, designed to avoid insider trading suspicion by scheduling trades in advance, has surged by 55% among nonexecutive directors since 2008. Some directors use these plans for rapid large-scale stock sales.

Many high school seniors face the challenge of evaluating college acceptance and financial-aid offers, but colleges use non-uniform language in their aid packages, making comparison difficult. Only a fraction adopt the U.S. Department of Education’s standardized “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet”.

However, a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that the actual number of jobs produced was significantly lower than the 100,000 direct jobs reported by companies benefiting from the program.
