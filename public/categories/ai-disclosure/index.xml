      <description>U.S. companies are beginning to change the way they police trades by executives and other insiders in their company stock.
U.S. companies are revising trading rules for executives, with some introducing longer &amp;ldquo;cooling-off periods&amp;rdquo; before trades can occur after establishing preset trading plans. The changes come after a series of Wall Street Journal articles highlighting profitable, well-timed trades by company insiders. Read the full story here.</description>

      <title>Corporate Insiders Shift From &#39;Buy&#39; to &#39;Sell&#39; as Bankruptcy Nears</title>

      <description>A Wall Street Journal review of thousands of trades by insiders in their own company&amp;rsquo;s stock found the trades veering heavily toward selling rather than buying as bankruptcy filings drew nearer.
We found that corporate insiders often shift from buying to selling their company&amp;rsquo;s stock as bankruptcy approaches. Our analysis suggests insiders might be privy to their company&amp;rsquo;s deteriorating conditions ahead of other investors. In the last three months before bankruptcy filings, insider stock buys dropped over 80%, while sales only slightly decreased.</description>

      <description>Stock &amp;ldquo;pinning&amp;rdquo; is the tendency of stocks to close precisely at their nearest option strike price and is a regular feature of expiration Fridays. A Wall Street Journal examination of trading behavior from the start of 2007 through April 2013, using a list of all U.S. stocks with options from DeltaNeutral.com, gives a sense of the phenomenon&amp;rsquo;s prevalence.
We analyzed trading behaviors from 2007 to April 2013 using U.S. stocks with options data.</description>

      <title>Data Shine Light on Hospital Bills</title>

      <description>The release of government data showing wide variation in hospital pricing removes a layer of secrecy but probably won&amp;rsquo;t make medical charges more uniform, experts said Wednesday.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released data revealing significant variations in hospital pricing for common treatments from 3,337 hospitals. The disclosed prices often don&amp;rsquo;t reflect the actual amounts paid, with numerous entities like Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers negotiating different rates. Despite the data&amp;rsquo;s transparency, experts believe it might not standardize medical charges, and its usefulness for consumers determining out-of-pocket costs is limited.</description>

      <description>Prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into whether corporate directors misused government-sanctioned trading plans to sell company shares for investment funds they run.
Federal prosecutors are investigating potential misuse of 10b5-1 plans by corporate directors, allowing them to sell company shares even when privy to nonpublic information about their firms. The probe was triggered by a Wall Street Journal article detailing trading activities at several companiues. Read the full story here.</description>

      <title>Directors Take Shelter in Trading Plans</title>

      <description>Corporate board members are increasingly using a type of opaque trading plan that was originally intended primarily for executives.
The use of government-sanctioned 10b5-1 trading plans, designed to avoid insider trading suspicion by scheduling trades in advance, has surged by 55% among nonexecutive directors since 2008. Some directors use these plans for rapid large-scale stock sales. Critics argue that these trading plans may sometimes be abused, especially by board members who also run investment funds, potentially leading to the appearance of impropriety.</description>

      <description>Many schools&amp;rsquo; financial-aid letters are devilishly difficult to figure out. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know.
Many high school seniors face the challenge of evaluating college acceptance and financial-aid offers, but colleges use non-uniform language in their aid packages, making comparison difficult. Only a fraction adopt the U.S. Department of Education&amp;rsquo;s standardized &amp;ldquo;Financial Aid Shopping Sheet&amp;rdquo;. College costs go beyond tuition and fees; they include transportation, textbooks, and living expenses. Some colleges may provide more generous grants to freshmen but reduce them for upperclassmen.</description>

      <description>A WSJ investigation into asbestos trust claims and court cases of roughly 850,000 people filed since the late 1980s found many apparent anomalies.
Asbestos claims continue rising by 85 per day even as asbestos usage has declined. Our analysis of claims data found anomalies like over 2,000 claimants saying they were exposed under age 12, and discrepancies between disease types reported to trusts versus courts. Trusts have reduced payout rates as assets deplete rapidly from mounting claims.</description>

      <description>Most people assume a degree in the arts is no guarantee of riches. Now there is evidence that such graduates also rack up the most student-loan debt.
Graduates from arts-focused schools accrue the highest student-loan debt, with a median debt load of $21,576, and often have starting salaries around $40,000. Our analysis of Department of Education data found that research university graduates typically have less student loan debt than those from liberal-arts colleges: $18,100 versus $19,445, respectively.</description>

      <description>Regulators will step up their focus on trading by corporate executives this year, according to a large international law firm that is pressing corporate boards to increase oversight of executive-trading plans.
Regulators will increase scrutiny on trading by corporate executives, pushing corporate boards to enhance oversight of executive-trading plans and ensure compliance beyond just the letter of the law. Concerns arise from loopholes in 10b5-1 plans, which allow executives to trade company shares even with private company knowledge, given the plans were established without such knowledge; there&amp;rsquo;s currently minimal oversight and public disclosure requirements for these plans.</description>

      <description>A medical-supplies company made a $43 million repurchase of its own shares last year, buoying the stock before bad news hit, even as four top managers were selling company shares.
A medical-supplies firm repurchased a significant amount of its own shares, boosting the stock&amp;rsquo;s value, while four top executives sold their company shares. A month later, the stock experienced a 9% drop following the announcement of poor earnings. Some employees within the firm expressed concerns about the trading activities.</description>

      <description>The SEC is facing mounting pressure to tighten its rules, following a Wall Street Journal investigation that found profitable and well-timed trades by more than 1,400 executives.
In 2007, a senior securities regulator cautioned about the potential misuse of preset plans by executives to trade their companies&amp;rsquo; stock based on inside information. Following a Wall Street Journal investigation revealing well-timed trades by over 1,400 executives, pressure has mounted on the SEC to tighten its rules.</description>

      <description>An investigation of insider trading by corporate executives found many make profitable trades prior to news announcements.
Our analysis found that many executives made trades yielding considerable profits just before significant company news announcements. Of 20,237 executives we looked at, 1,418 experienced an average gain of 10% in their trades one week before significant news releases. This rate of profit was notably higher than that of executives who faced negative stock movements.</description>

      <description>An analysis by The Wall Street Journal shows that banks&amp;rsquo; submissions used to calculate the London interbank offered rate often are slow to change and sometimes fail to track the market&amp;rsquo;s view of the credit risk posed by each firm.
We found that banks&amp;rsquo; submissions used to determine the London interbank offered rate (Libor) frequently remain static and often don&amp;rsquo;t align with the market&amp;rsquo;s perception of each firm&amp;rsquo;s credit risk, leading to questions about Libor&amp;rsquo;s credibility.</description>

      <description>At a time when the overall U.S. homicide rate is declining, more civilians are killing each other and claiming self-defense&amp;ndash;a trend that is most pronounced in states with new &amp;ldquo;stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws.
The U.S. has seen a notable increase in justifiable homicides, particularly in states with &amp;ldquo;stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws, even as the overall homicide rate declines. &amp;ldquo;Stand your ground&amp;rdquo; laws allow individuals greater latitude in using force for self-defense outside the home.</description>

      <title>Cost of $10 Billion Stimulus Easier to Tally Than New Jobs</title>

      <description>The U.S. government allocated more than $10 billion under section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote job creation and renewable energy through the establishment of wind farms, solar projects, and other alternative energy initiatives. However, a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that the actual number of jobs produced was significantly lower than the 100,000 direct jobs reported by companies benefiting from the program. This discrepancy underscores the challenges in accurately quantifying the economic impact of stimulus spending, with some plants laying off workers and others shutting down altogether.</description>

      <description>Results from Russia&amp;rsquo;s parliamentary vote earlier this month are studded with red flags that suggest broad electoral fraud, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.
Our analysis of nearly 100,000 voting precincts reveals potential vote-rigging, with up to 14 million votes in question. Higher turnout areas showed suspiciously strong support for Putin&amp;rsquo;s United Russia party. Large-scale protests have erupted in response to allegations of fraud, challenging Putin&amp;rsquo;s political legitimacy. In response, Putin promises transparent measures for upcoming elections.</description>
