      <description>U.S. companies are beginning to change the way they police trades by executives and other insiders in their company stock.
U.S. companies are revising trading rules for executives, with some introducing longer &amp;ldquo;cooling-off periods&amp;rdquo; before trades can occur after establishing preset trading plans. The changes come after a series of Wall Street Journal articles highlighting profitable, well-timed trades by company insiders. Read the full story here.</description>

      <description>A Wall Street Journal review of thousands of trades by insiders in their own company&amp;rsquo;s stock found the trades veering heavily toward selling rather than buying as bankruptcy filings drew nearer.
We found that corporate insiders often shift from buying to selling their company&amp;rsquo;s stock as bankruptcy approaches. Our analysis suggests insiders might be privy to their company&amp;rsquo;s deteriorating conditions ahead of other investors. In the last three months before bankruptcy filings, insider stock buys dropped over 80%, while sales only slightly decreased.</description>

      <description>Stock &amp;ldquo;pinning&amp;rdquo; is the tendency of stocks to close precisely at their nearest option strike price and is a regular feature of expiration Fridays. A Wall Street Journal examination of trading behavior from the start of 2007 through April 2013, using a list of all U.S. stocks with options from DeltaNeutral.com, gives a sense of the phenomenon&amp;rsquo;s prevalence.

      <description>Prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into whether corporate directors misused government-sanctioned trading plans to sell company shares for investment funds they run.

      <description>Corporate board members are increasingly using a type of opaque trading plan that was originally intended primarily for executives.
The use of government-sanctioned 10b5-1 trading plans, designed to avoid insider trading suspicion by scheduling trades in advance, has surged by 55% among nonexecutive directors since 2008. Some directors use these plans for rapid large-scale stock sales. Critics argue that these trading plans may sometimes be abused, especially by board members who also run investment funds, potentially leading to the appearance of impropriety.</description>

      <description>Regulators will step up their focus on trading by corporate executives this year, according to a large international law firm that is pressing corporate boards to increase oversight of executive-trading plans.
Regulators will increase scrutiny on trading by corporate executives, pushing corporate boards to enhance oversight of executive-trading plans and ensure compliance beyond just the letter of the law. Concerns arise from loopholes in 10b5-1 plans, which allow executives to trade company shares even with private company knowledge, given the plans were established without such knowledge; there&amp;rsquo;s currently minimal oversight and public disclosure requirements for these plans.</description>

Of 20,237 executives we looked at, 1,418 experienced an average gain of 10% in their trades one week before significant news releases. This rate of profit was notably higher than that of executives who faced negative stock movements.</description>

We found that banks&amp;rsquo; submissions used to determine the London interbank offered rate (Libor) frequently remain static and often don&amp;rsquo;t align with the market&amp;rsquo;s perception of each firm&amp;rsquo;s credit risk, leading to questions about Libor&amp;rsquo;s credibility.</description>
