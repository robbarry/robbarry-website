      <description>Fidelity Investments has fired or allowed more than 200 employees to resign over alleged misuse of workplace-benefits programs, according to people familiar with the matter.
Fidelity Investments conducted an internal review of their reimbursement programs. Widespread misuse was found with employees buying and canceling orders but still claiming reimbursements. Over 200 employees were either fired or allowed to resign due to these findings. Fidelity offered reimbursements for up to 20% of computer costs and also for physical fitness products.</description>
