      <description>Journal reporters pieced together stockbroker records from 27 states detailing the disciplinary and employment histories of about 550,000, or 87%, of the country&amp;rsquo;s stockbrokers, over their careers. Many brokers were registered in multiple states. New York&amp;rsquo;s Office of the Attorney General didn&amp;rsquo;t provide 2014 data on customer complaints against brokers, so the analysis used the state&amp;rsquo;s complaints data from 2013. The other data in the analysis were compiled in the 2014 first half.</description>
