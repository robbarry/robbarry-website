      <description>In the wake of the coup, the Kremlin faces challenges in its bid to take over Wagner paramilitary group&amp;rsquo;s extensive global network. Founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner&amp;rsquo;s intricate web of companies, involved in war, security, and mining operations, have blurred ties with the Russian government. The group&amp;rsquo;s vast structure and Prigozhin&amp;rsquo;s recent disappearance further complicate the Kremlin&amp;rsquo;s mission. Learn more in our story here.</description>

Our documentary focuses on the group&amp;rsquo;s sprawling business interests, looking at how Wagner promotes the Kremlin&amp;rsquo;s strategic ambitions across four continents while plundering local resources such as gold and diamonds.</description>
