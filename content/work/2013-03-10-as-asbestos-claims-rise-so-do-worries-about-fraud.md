A WSJ investigation into asbestos trust claims and court cases of roughly
850,000 people filed since the late 1980s found many apparent anomalies.

- Asbestos claims continue rising by 85 per day even as asbestos usage has
  declined.
- Our analysis of claims data found anomalies like over 2,000 claimants saying
  they were exposed under age 12, and discrepancies between disease types
  reported to trusts versus courts.
- Trusts have reduced payout rates as assets deplete rapidly from mounting
  claims. Judges are allowing trust subpoenas to try to expose fraudulent
  claims.
- Lawyers advise trusts and influence policies while also seeking payouts for
  clients, a potential conflict. A lack of transparency enables abuse as trusts
  don't scrutinize claims like court cases.
- There are worries that depletion of trust assets could leave many victims
  uncompensated even as claims continue rising.
