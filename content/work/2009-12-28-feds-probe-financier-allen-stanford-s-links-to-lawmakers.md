Just hours after federal agents charged banker Allen Stanford with fleecing investors of $7 billion, the disgraced financier received a message from one of Congress' most powerful members, Pete Sessions. "I love you and believe in you," said the e-mail sent on Feb. 17. "If you want my ear/voice -- e-mail," it said, signed "Pete."
