Check out our investigative documentary on the mysterious Wagner Group. Over the years, under the leadership of Yevgeny Prigozhin, it has grown from a small, clandestine force into a global war cartel now heavily involved in Russia's assault in Ukraine.

Our documentary focuses on the group's sprawling business interests, looking at how Wagner promotes the Kremlin's strategic ambitions across four continents while plundering local resources such as gold and diamonds.
