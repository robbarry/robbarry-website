At a time when the overall U.S. homicide rate is declining, more civilians are
killing each other and claiming self-defense--a trend that is most pronounced in
states with new "stand your ground" laws.

- The U.S. has seen a notable increase in justifiable homicides, particularly in
  states with "stand your ground" laws, even as the overall homicide rate
  declines. "Stand your ground" laws allow individuals greater latitude in using
  force for self-defense outside the home. From 2000 to 2010, justifiable
  homicides almost doubled to 326 cases.
- Our analysis found around 60% of justifiable homicides involved strangers,
  compared to non-justifiable homicides where victims often knew their killers.
  Firearms were used in over 80% of justifiable homicides, and in racial
  breakdowns, when killer and victim were of different races, justifiable
  homicide victims were more often black.
- The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida by a neighborhood
  watchman, in an incident linked to the state's "stand your ground" law, has
  sparked a national debate about these laws, their implications, and the role
  of race in such cases.
