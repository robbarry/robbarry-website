The federal government's troubles combating Russian trolls spreading fake news isn't its only problem on social media. It is also struggling to keep track of which accounts are its own.

- The U.S. Geological Survey's National Atlas Twitter account started posting political messages in Russian.
- Although deleted by the U.S., the account was still listed on the official government Digital Registry.
- 10 accounts on the registry were not under U.S. control; four tweeted in other languages.
- The registry's accuracy has come under scrutiny, as it was designed to verify official government social media accounts.
- Issues arise when government Twitter accounts change names or are deleted, and new users assume old names.
- Notably, screen names linked to the Department of Homeland Security were taken over.
- The Journal found three U.S. government accounts listed on the registry were suspended by Twitter for violating terms.
