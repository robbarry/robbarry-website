I fell into journalism in 2006 with a
[story](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-miami-herald-new-school-to-open-amid/132338355/)
that started as a simple assignment about a local charter school opening for The
Miami Herald's _Neighbors_ section, and turned into something more.

In the ensuing years, I got drafted onto the Herald's investigative team, where
I worked on three major projects: _Borrower's Betrayed_, about the subprime
mortgage crisis; _Key's to the Kingdom_, about Alan Stanford's Ponzi scheme; and
_Neglected to Death_, about Florida's failure to protect its elderly and
disabled.

I joined The Wall Street Journal in 2011, where I've worked on a range of
stories and projects, including _Accounting for Terror_, a series about terror
financing; _Putin's Power_, a project looking at the Russian president's inner
circle; and _Inside TikTok's Dangerously Addictive Algorithm_, where we
reverse-engineered the popular social media app's algorithm using a tower of
Raspberry Pi minicomputers and a swath of AI and machine-learning techniques.

In 2015, armed with a trove of billions of previously confidential billing
records, we used statistical analyses and shoe-leather reporting to unravel
millions of dollars in Medicare fraud. The project, _Medicare Unmasked_, won the
2015 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting.
