Hey there! I'm Rob Barry. I'm the Director of Data Journalsm at The Wall Street
Journal, where I lead an incredibly talented team of reporters who specialize in 
obsessing over complex data sets and turning them into groundbreaking stories.

I love investigative reporting, programming and getting to the bottom of
mysteries. I have expertise reverse-engineering algorithms, deep-diving into
offshore money networks, sleuthing through public records and helping create
big, data-driven projects.

Before joining the WSJ in 2011, I worked at the Miami Herald, where I did
a bunch of jobs, ranging from covering life in North Miami Beach to hand-crafting
a quirky

for [Pedro Pans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Peter_Pan). I'm driven
by curiosity, teamwork, accountability and the thrill of the chase.
