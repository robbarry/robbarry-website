I'm Rob Barry, an investigative reporter and data editor at The Wall Street Journal. I help lead a team of reporters who specialize in computer programming and data analysis.

My job has given me an opportunity to do all sorts of crazy things, including creating hundreds of TikTok bots using Raspberry Pis, tracking a Chinese government hacker group through some of the world's largest corporations and unraveling a secret Russian global paramilitary empire.

Along the way, some of the work has been by awards including a [Pulitzer Prize](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-new-york-times-win-pulitzers-1429557628) and four Gerald Loeb Awards.
