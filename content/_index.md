title: About Me
---
I'm Rob Barry, an investigative reporter and data editor at The Wall Street
Journal, where I lead a team specializing in computer programming and data
analysis.

My career has taken me on many adventures, from building hundreds of TikTok bots
with Raspberry Pis to tracking a Chinese government hacker group inside major
global corporations to exposing a covert Russian global paramilitary network.

My work has earned accolades, including a [Pulitzer
Prize](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-new-york-times-win-pulitzers-1429557628)
and four Gerald Loeb Awards.
