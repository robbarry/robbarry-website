Hey there! I'm Rob Barry. I've spent my days&mdash;and let's be honest, many
late nights&mdash;obsessing over complex data sets and turning them into
investigative stories at The Wall Street Journal. I love investigative
reporting, programming and getting to the bottom of mysteries.

Outside of helping lead a brilliant team of reporters who specialize in computer
programming and data analysis, you might catch me reverse-engineering algorithms
or deep-diving into offshore money networks. I've been honored with awards that
recognize the impact of my work, but what drives me is a good team and an
important mission.

Before my days at WSJ, I spent some great years at The Miami Herald, where my
adventures ranged from covering life in North Miami Beach to hand-crafting a
quirky

for [Pedro Pans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Peter_Pan). I'm driven
by curiosity, a passion for teamwork, and, sometimes, the simple thrill of the
chase.
